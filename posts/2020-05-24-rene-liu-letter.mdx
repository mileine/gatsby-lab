Essa música é da cantora taiwanesa Rene Liu e se chama "Continue - A letter to 15 years-old me". Uma viagem no tempo muito boa.

<blockquote>
Did you know, the 15 year old, unhappy you is always on my mind<br />
How I want to pull the crying you into my embrace<br />
You weren't sure of your shape<br />
Often at odds with the world<br />
Those wounds, I have healed them all for you<br /><br />
The hardest question you were asked in school<br />
All it took to solve it was a few lines of notes<br />
But now, I often like to recall<br />
Recall the 15 year old you who refused to give up<br />
Will the rain stop coming down from the sky? Will it get sunny?<br />
Will happiness be waiting for you and me at the destination?<br />
Would I forget, and still be able to bravely stand in the rain?<br />
Let us keep walking, keep progressing<br />
walking towards the unknown journey that we are expectant of<br />
When you're tired, let's embrace our sincerity<br />
and quietly sleep well<br /><br />
In these years, I've been doing well, at least I didn't let myself down<br />
Thank you, it's your purity that has given me guidance<br />
I've met a lot of people, achieved some accomplishments<br />
You most likely aren't able to imagine yet, how awesome those experiences were<br />
Who says life is fair?<br />
It doesn't care what we want<br />
Thanks for your adamancy<br />
It's because of that, that I was able to become who I am today<br /><br />
Let's keep walking, keep progressing<br />
and see where this road is willing to take us<br />
Let none of us say "let's give up" nor say "I give up hope"<br />
Always listen to the voice in you<br />
When you feel tired, please hold my hand tightly<br /><br />
There are no maps, the only thing to refer to in life is the dream in our hands<br />
Follow its light, bending, finding the place with light<br />
La la la<br />
La la la Our dream from that year<br />
La la la<br />
La la la People need a dream, a brave dream, a crazy dream<br />
Keep walking, keep progressing<br />
beside the road, there are flowers, in our hearts, there's music, in the sky, there are stars<br /><br />
The place where we're going must have the most beautiful scenery<br />
Oh Let none of us give up, nor say "I give up hope"<br />
Don't let down the pure self within our heart<br />
When you're in so much pain you want to cry, let tears wash away our sadness<br />
We need to believe in ourselves, always believe<br />
Our coming into this world isn't meaningless<br />
The things we've done would stay in people's minds<br />
remembered and cherished<br />
One day, I will grow old, I hope you will be satisfied<br />
that I didn't let down, the 15 year old me<br />
