Did you know, the 15 year old, unhappy you is always on my mind
How I want to pull the crying you into my embrace
You weren't sure of your shape
Often at odds with the world
Those wounds, I have healed them all for you
 
The hardest question you were asked in school
All it took to solve it was a few lines of notes
But now, I often like to recall
Recall the 15 year old you who refused to give up
Will the rain stop coming down from the sky? Will it get sunny?
Will happiness be waiting for you and me at the destination?
Would I forget, and still be able to bravely stand in the rain?
Let us keep walking, keep progressing
walking towards the unknown journey that we are expectant of
When you're tired, let's embrace our sincerity
and quietly sleep well
 
In these years, I've been doing well, at least I didn't let myself down
Thank you, it's your purity that has given me guidance
I've met a lot of people, achieved some accomplishments
You most likely aren't able to imagine yet, how awesome those experiences were
Who says life is fair?
It doesn't care what we want
Thanks for your adamancy
It's because of that, that I was able to become who I am today
 
Let's keep walking, keep progressing
and see where this road is willing to take us
Let none of us say "let's give up" nor say "I give up hope"
Always listen to the voice in you
When you feel tired, please hold my hand tightly
 
There are no maps, the only thing to refer to in life is the dream in our hands
Follow its light, bending, finding the place with light
La la la
La la la Our dream from that year
La la la
La la la People need a dream, a brave dream, a crazy dream
Keep walking, keep progressing
beside the road, there are flowers, in our hearts, there's music, in the sky, there are stars
 
The place where we're going must have the most beautiful scenery
Oh Let none of us give up, nor say "I give up hope"
Don't let down the pure self within our heart
When you're in so much pain you want to cry, let tears wash away our sadness
We need to believe in ourselves, always believe
Our coming into this world isn't meaningless
The things we've done would stay in people's minds
remembered and cherished
One day, I will grow old, I hope you will be satisfied
that I didn't let down, the 15 year old me
