Highlights:

* What is a Design System?
* Design systems is not a one person project.
* Make sure your DS improves your users' work.
  (Eg.: Prevents rework, bugs. Improves accessibility.)
* If you are the only person fighting for it, maybe you should think if it's really suitable for your project.
* You might not need a design system.
