Last week, I bumped into [What To Do When You Fail To Reach Your Goals](https://www.fluent.show/103) episode from [FluentShow](https://www.fluent.show/) podcast. It made me think about lessons I've learned from my failures in setting and achieving language learning goals. 🤔

## Finding my Why 💗

When I was a teenager, I wanted to learn different languages to become a polyglot. No matter what, I wanted to be able to communicate in *Spanish*, *Italian*, *French, German* and *Italian*. It took decades for me to realize there's no meaning to learn a language if you can't find content in that language that you're interested in. I always struggled to find content (tv shows, music and so on) to practice these languages. I used to think of language as a goal.

Last year, I finally realized the languages I wanted to learn the most were the asian ones: *Japanese*, *Mandarin* and *Korean**. I love asian music, dramas, food, mindset and culture. Thanks to the Internet I have an infinite number of dramas I want to watch and songs I want to learn. I finally had a real why to learn these languages. Thus, becoming a polyglot would be a consequence, not a goal anymore. Because now I think of language as a tool. A tool I love. But now I know **why**. ☺️

**My why lies in content.** Asian Culture, TV Shows, Dramas and Music.🇯🇵🇹🇼🇨🇳🇰🇷

These reflections reminded me something Steve Kauffman has said in one of his latest videos: [I Was Wrong, Stephen Krashen's Right. Content is King for Language Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Erkps2En8)

## Being Realistic 🌎

Ok. I want to be able to communicate in *Japanese*, *Mandarin* and *Korean* someday.

That's how I spent 2017 trying to learn them all. And that's how I failed. 🙄

Last year, I worked until I got myself burned out on these languages: took private lessons, studied for certificates in Mandarin and in Korean. But by the end of the year, I just gave up. I got overwhelmed by everything else I had to do on daily basis: work, work, work, planning a wedding, house chores and so on.

This year, I tried to be more **realistic with my language goals**. I decided to focus on **Mandarin**.

**Why Mandarin? Because...**

1. Because my favourite band is Taiwanese: **Mayday 五月天**.
2. Most of **TV Shows, Dramas, Songs** I like and want to learn new words from are in Mandarin.
3. **I'm in love with Taipei.** Some people love Paris, other love New York. Some people left their hearts in San Francisco. I left mine in Taipei.
4. It can become a very useful tool for **work**.

Not only I decided to focus on **Mandarin** but also limited my goals to improving my ***Listening* *skills* for 2018**. That's right, until next January/2019 I won't worry about speaking. And I won't worry about reading/writing until January/2020.

I decided to take it easy and be patient with myself. 😌

## Being Patient 🤗

Patience means trusting I'm getting to where I aim for.

I trust I'm going to reach my language goals for Mandarin, Japanese and Korean. That's how I know there's no need to rush. I'll just enjoy the path. 🛤

## Enjoying the Path 🙃

I'll keep focusing on Mandarin (listening) to work on Anki, FluentU, LingQ and all learning material until next December. But that doesn't mean I cannot have some fun with Japanese and Korean languages.

I often watch Korean dramas and listen to K-pop with my husband. 🇰🇷

Also, my Mandarin teacher is my Japanese teacher. So I get to chat in Japanese once a month. 🇯🇵

This is the best time to learn languages.🤗❣️
