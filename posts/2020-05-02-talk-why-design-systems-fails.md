Hightlights:

- What is a Design System?
- Design systems is not a one person project.
- Make sure your DS improves your users' work.
(Eg.: Prevents rework, bugs. Improves accessibility.)
- If you are the only person fighting for it, maybe you should think if it's really suitable for your project.
- You might not need a design system.
