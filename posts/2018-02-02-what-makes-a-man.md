I first read about *Flow State* in March 2013, on a book called [Mapping Inner Space](https://www.amazon.com.br/Mapping-Inner-Space-Learning-Teaching/dp/1569761388). It was a book about *Visual Thinking* and the concept really made feel intrigued since I had experienced this *flow state* without knowing it has been studied in psychology for decades. A couple of months later, I read about it again on a book called [The Adventures of Johnny Bunko](https://www.amazon.com.br/Adventures-Johnny-Bunko-Career-Guide/dp/1594482918). Since then, I couldn't help noticing moments when I got *in the zone*. ðŸ¤—

According to MihÃ¡ly Csikszentmihaly (father of this concept):

> In [positive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology "Positive psychology"), **flow**, also known colloquially as being in **the zone**, is the [mental state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state "Mental state") of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting loss in one's sense of space and time.

You can learn more about it from the Mihaly himself, in his [TED Talk](https://youtu.be/fXIeFJCqsPs).

I think the best part of being aware of what makes me get in the zone is that it helps me to identify what are the little - and simple - things that brings joy and meaning to my days. Suddenly I realize there are many things from this list I take for granted - or keep postponing because it sounds... boring .
